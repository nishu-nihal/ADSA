// 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int length = sb.length();
            if (length > 0 && sb.charAt(length - 1) == c) {
                // Remove the previous character because it is a duplicate
                sb.deleteCharAt(length - 1);
            } else {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
